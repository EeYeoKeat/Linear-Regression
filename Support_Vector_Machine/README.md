# Supervised-Learning-Models

In machine learning, support-vector machines are one of supervised learning models. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.

# Credits
This code is modified from other tutorial. I am fresh in supervised learning model during the time I experiment on this work.My research will be mainly focus on reinforcement learning model. All of the machine learning models has own strength in problem solving.
