# Logistic Regression


A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. In logistic regression, the main function of the sigmoid function is to convert a real-valued number to a probability of a positive outcome. In general, the sigmoid function can be represented by the equation.

and the typical logistic curve as shown as following.

## All about Mathematics

I have learned the fundamental theory and important equation for logistic regression from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning course</a> provided by Andrew Ng. The fundamental is essential for us get the intuition on how the logistic regression works. We can even build the machine learning models from scratch without rely on ready-use machine learning libraries.
