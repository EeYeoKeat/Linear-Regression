# Mathematics behind Machine Learning

This repository are collection of codes files study about mathematics functions in analysis problem including some of the machine learning algorithms. It is mainly for self-revision purpose. I try to understand the concept, therefore, majority is built from scratch without using ready-use ML libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras.
